# info-retrieval-dictionary

Please note: Porter's Stemmer was used in this project and is not our unique work. All of that code is located in src/stemmer.c . It can also be found directly from the original author here: https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/


The project appears to run well although sometimes the stemmer will not return the correct index in the string for the tokenizer to cut the string. 


To compile, type "make"

To run, use "./dictionary". 
Required arguments: -i \<input file name\>.
Optional arguments: -d \<dictionary output file name\>, -p \<posting output file name\> 

To clean, run "make clean"


We have done this assignment
completely on our own except for the software/tools acknowledged in the project report. We
have not copied it, nor have we given our solution to anyone else. We understand that if we
are involved in plagiarism or cheating we will have to sign an official form that we have
cheated and that this form will be stored in our official university record. We also understand
that we will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment and our grades will be reduced
by one level (e.g., from A to A- or from B+ to B) for the first offense, and that we will
receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense of any kind.
